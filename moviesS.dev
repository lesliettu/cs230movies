94  my name is albert ayler documentary musical performing arts special interest with his documentary my name is albert ayler , swedish filmmaker kasper collin pays unbridled homage to the titular musician , one of the most innovative and electric but least known figures in contemporary jazz . ayler's obscurity is at least as attributable to his short lifespan as it is to his musical iconoclasm he died under bizarre and inexplicable circumstances in late 1970 ; on november 5 of that year , manhattan police found his 34 year old body floating in the city's east river , possibly though not definitively a victim of suicide . collin approaches ayler's life as a straightforward narrative , segueing smoothly from touchstone to touchstone . the picture thus covers the musician's upbringing in cleveland , oh ; his performances on the saxophone and oboe in a military band ; his critical , shaping experiences in touring r b groups across the u . s . ; and finally , his decision to spin that r b music off into an unprecedented form of experimental jazz on the landscapes of new york city and stockholm , sweden . collin's narrative ends , of course , with speculation on ayler's death . collin devotes much screen time to an exploration of ayler's friendship with the legendary john coltrane , and to the sad reality that during the 1960s , truly groundbreaking jazz by african american artists could only flourish in ber progressive europe . throughout the picture , the documentarian works in extremely rare archival footage of ayler , and roots much of his narrative in interviews with such key figures as ayler's sunday school teacher father in his nineties at the time of this production ; ayler's brother donald , also a musician , and one with a history of severe mental disturbance ; and a number of ayler's nonfamilial musical collaborators including sunny murray and gary peacock . ayler's romantic partner and sometime musical collaborator , mary parks , declined to appear onscreen , though collin works in extracts from a telephone interview with her . it goes without saying that my name is albert ayler represents the only documentary portrait to date of the wondrous musician .
