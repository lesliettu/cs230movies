100  abraham lincoln classics drama to date , this d . w . griffith epic is the only talking picture effort to encapsulate the entire life of abraham lincoln , from cradle to grave . the script , credited to stephen vincent benet , manages to include all the familiar high points , including lincoln's tragic romance with ann rutledge una merkel , allegedly cast because of her resemblance to griffith favorite lillian gish , his lawyer days in illinois , his contentious marriage to mary todd kay hammond , his heartbreaking decision to declare war upon the south , his pardoning of a condemned sentry during the civil war , and his assassination at the hands of john wilkes booth expansively portrayed by ian keith . this was d . w . griffith's first talkie , and the master does his best with the somewhat pedantic dialogue sequences ; but as always , griffith's forte was spectacle and montage , as witness the cross cut scenes of yankees and rebels marching off to war and the pulse pounding ride of general sheridan frank campeau through the shenandoah valley . thanks to the wizardry of production designer william cameron menzies , many of the scenes appear far more elaborate than they really were ; menzies can also be credited with the unforgettable finale , as honest abe's kentucky log cabin dissolves to the lincoln memorial . as abraham lincoln , walter huston is a tower of strength , making even the most florid of speeches sound human and credible ; only during the protracted death scene of ann rutledge does huston falter , and then the fault is as much griffith's as his . road shown at nearly two hours including a prologue showing slaves being brought to america , abraham lincoln was pared down to 97 minutes by united artists , and in that length it proved a box office success , boding well for d . w . griffith's future in talkies alas , it proved to be his next to last film ; griffith's final effort , the struggle was a financial disaster .
