drama no one living can say whether the original , ten hour version of erich von stroheim's most famous movie was the epic masterpiece it was touted to be . the 140 minute version is all that remains , and while it's only a quarter of the film it was meant to be , it's still one of the greatest accomplishments of the silent film era . based on the turn of the century novel mcteague by frank norris , greed takes place primarily in the san francisco of the early 1900's . mcteague gibson gowland , a brutish , earthy man comes to practice dentistry in the lower middle class polk street district . there he meets and befriends marcus schouler jean hersholt . one day marcus brings in his cousin and girlfriend , trina sieppe zasu pitts for some dental work . a romance between mcteague and trina gradually ensues , and marcus graciously steps aside until he discovers that trina has won 5000 dollars in a lottery . he jealously watches as trina and mcteague get married . but all is not well with the couple trina holds onto her winnings for dear life , refusing to let go of a cent , even when they are forced to live in reduced circumstances because mcteague has lost his practice marcus has turned him in for not having a license . mcteague takes to drink as he and trina sink into poverty and violent arguments break out between them . finally mcteague leaves his miserly wife , who is now working as a charwoman during the day while gloating over her gold coins at night . but he later returns , intoxicated , to her squalid room and murders her , escaping with her money . he flees across the desert , pursued by a posse which includes marcus , who still lusts after the gold . the two finally meet up on the cracked , overheated salt flats and fight to the death . but as mcteague gives marcus the fatal blow , marcus snaps his handcuffs around mcteague's wrist . thus , mcteague must die in the middle of the desert , cuffed to the dead marcus with the gold by his side . as norris's novel was a protest against the elaborate fluff that was popular reading during the end of the 19th century , greed was a protest against the pretentiousness and glamour that was part and parcel of hollywood in the '20s . nevertheless , it is a stunning visual work , and the overall sordidness of the film has a dreamy , rather nightmarish aura . out of any american director of his era , only von stroheim could have found such beauty in ugliness and created such fascination for the commonplace . he shot greed with utter faithfulness to the norris book and proposed to run the lengthy film on more than one evening , but the idea was far ahead of its time and the releasing studio , metrogoldwyn mayer , insisted on radical trimming . some of the cuts are tragic the introduction of mcteague's character makes him seem particularly loutish , and later it is difficult to tell whether trina is merely a prim victorian maiden , or if she is truly repulsed by the advances of her husband to be . the loss of various subplots will also be cause for eternal speculation by film historians . however , enough of greed remains to prove that von stroheim was an early example of an auteur par excellence . greed

art house international classics drama anyone interested in making a low budget movie ought to see orson welles' screen adaptation of william shakespeare's othello , a striking example of how much can be achieved with very little money . for years , stories about this singularly troubled movie circulated more widely than the film itself ; welles began shooting othello without securing full financing , so he would gather his cast , assemble a crew , and shoot until his money ran out . he would then take an acting assignment to raise some cash , reassemble his cast , and start filming again until the latest batch of money was gone . for the sequence featuring the murder of cassio , welles depending on who tells the story either couldn't pay the bill for the costumes or they just didn't arrive in time , so he reset the scene in a turkish bath with his players wrapped in towels borrowed from their hotel . this process went on for four years ; by the time welles was done , the film was on its third desdemona , and the director , himself , had to dub several voices , since most of the dialogue was recorded after the fact . remarkably , the finished film not only isn't a disaster , it's a triumph , that rare example of a movie based on a shakespeare play that's as exciting to look at as it is to listen to . while welles pared the bard's story of jealousy , betrayal , and murder to the bone this version clocks in at a mere 92 minutes , the film's striking compositions and energetic quick cutting allow the camera to tell more of the story than almost any other shakespeare adaptation . repeat viewers will see that welles picked many of his camera angles to obscure the fact that othello's mighty army was merely a handful of extras , but the unexpected bonus is a lean , muscular look that's the perfect match for the film's brisk narrative style . the spare , but powerful , visuals feel like a product of expressionism , not a low budget , and the images have atmosphere to spare . in addition , it's truly a pleasure to hear welles' rich baritone wrap itself around shakespeare's dialogue ; his con brio performance as the noble moor undone by jealousy and betrayal has the impact of a fine stage rendition without overplaying its hand . michael macliammoir is his equal as the conniving and lustful iago , and had this film been more widely seen , it could well have sparked the successful screen career he so obviously deserved . and michael laurence is fine in an often witty turn as cassio with a verbal assistance from welles . only suzanne cloutier as the virtuous but wronged desdemona lacks the forceful presence of the rest of the cast though given how much of the role was edited away , it may not be entirely her fault . welles' daughter spearheaded a campaign to restore and re release othello in 1992 ; and while the digital sheen of the re recorded score sometimes makes for an odd contrast to the occasionally scratchy recordings of the dialogue , the new edition of the film looks better than ever both on the big screen and on video and is highly recommended to anyone who loves good acting or good cinema . mark deming , rovi othello the tragedy of othello the moor of venice
